# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses **multiple linear regression** to predict salaries in USD (`salary_in_usd`) based on two features: experience level (`experience_level`) and job title (`job_title`).

## What does this project do?

1. Trains a linear regression model to predict salaries.
2. Evaluates the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ².
3. Generates visualizations to show the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11.2
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
